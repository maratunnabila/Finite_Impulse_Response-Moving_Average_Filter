# Finite_Impulse_Response-Moving_Average_Filter
One of FIR signal processing method using MAV

This is my 5th Semester University Project on Biomedical Signal Processing Course
This GUI source code was created with Delphi 10.
In short, this project is designed to analyze how the frequency response of input, output, and noise is generated in the application of MAV.

The input signal is in the form of 3 sine signals with different amplitudes and frequencies, and sampled by n.
The output signal is a filtered signal that is given by the MAV filter whose order size is adjusted by the scroll bar.

We can see the magnitude response of the MAV filter, and we can also compare the results of the input signal, forward and backward signals, as well as the noise removed.
